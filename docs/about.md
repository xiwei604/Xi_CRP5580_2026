My name is **Xi Wei**.

This site documents my work for **CRP5580**, including GIS exercises, assignments, and a final project.

I am a PhD student at Iowa State University. I majored in civil engineering with a specialization in transportation, and much of my research work focuses on data-driven methods for traffic safety analysis. I got both my bachelor's and master's degrees from Iowa State!
